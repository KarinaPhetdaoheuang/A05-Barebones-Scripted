  <h1> <i>I Died for Beauty - but was Scarce</i> 
    by Emily Dickinson </h1>
  <a href="http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/beauty.html">Link to poem</a>
    
<p>
  I died for Beauty - but was scarce</br>
  Adjusted in the Tomb</br>
When One who died for Truth, was lain</br>
  In an adjoining Room -</p> 
<p>He questioned softly "Why I failed"?</br>
"For Beauty", I replied -</br>
"And I - for Truth - Themself are One -</br>
We Brethren are",  He said -></p>

<p>And so, as Kinsmen, met a Night â€”</br>
We talked between the Rooms -</br>
Until the Moss had reached our lips -</br>
  And covered up  - Our names -  </p>
